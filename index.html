            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <img src="img/september.webp" alt="kids-in-library">
            <h3>September 2014</h3>
            <p>After graduating from Drew University with a master's degree in Montessori pedagogy, the principal of our
                school opened a small study group in which children with special needs could learn new things in a
                playful way.</p>
            <img src="img/march.webp" alt="kids-are-drawing">
            <h3>March 2015</h3>
            <p>Our kids club grew and expanded. The question arose about opening a full-fledged school. Thanks to the
                parents and authorities of New York City, a special education school has emerged in 2000 and accepted
                the first 20 students.</p>

            <h3>May 2021</h3>
            <p>Due to the growing number of students, the school went through a major reorganization. Our school has
                moved to a new building, the staff of teachers has expanded. The school was already attended by 117
                students. </p>
